# About Me

I’ve always been passionate about creating websites since I was a child. Back then, I used website builders, even before platforms like Wix and Squarespace, to create my own custom blogs. It wasn’t until many years later that I decided to dive deeper into web development and learn how to design websites from scratch. Although I love creating websites, I am looking to enhance my skillsets and dive more into software development.
